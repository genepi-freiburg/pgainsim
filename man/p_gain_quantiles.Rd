\title{Computation of p-gain-quantiles for numbers of tests based on the result of function p_gain_simulation.}
\usage{
p_gain_quantiles(n_tests, sim_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_tests}{Integer. The number of tests for which the pgain-quantile should be computed. It depends on the available number of datapoints.}

\item{sim_data}{data frame. Each column describes simulated p-gain-values for the allele frequency, which is in the column name. Output of function p_gain_simulation.}
}
\value{
p_gain_quant data frame. Columns describe pgain-quantiles for different allele frequenciey (numeric values) and rows discribe number of tests.
}
